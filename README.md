# MacCrypter
MacCrypter is a command-line tool that protects your Bash and Python scripts. It uses bash-obfuscator to make shell scripts unreadable and Python's marshal to compile code into secure bytecode. Its simple menu makes it fast and easy to protect your work before you share or distribute it.
